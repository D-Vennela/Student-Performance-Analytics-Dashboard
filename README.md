# Student-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 10,000+ student records to uncover academic performance patterns, trends across grades, and group-wise outcomes. Built for data analysis internships—demonstrates EDA, DAX measures, and visual storytelling.
​

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Filters, aggregations, and comparisons revealing grade disparities (e.g., 15% gap in underperforming groups).

Visualizations: Bar charts, distribution plots, slicers for dynamic insights—99% data consistency validated.

Interactivity: Drill-downs, cross-filtering for non-technical users (e.g., educators, stakeholders).

DAX Measures: Custom calculations for performance metrics, averages, and trends.
